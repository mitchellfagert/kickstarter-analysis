# Kickstarter Analysis Project

## Overview of Project
 -Using data from thousands of Crowd Source funding projects, I created two deliverables to help understand how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
 -To provide a visual representation of play/campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
 -Using current data was a challenge for this analysis. Our data represents campaigns from the years **2009-2017**. Using data that is 5 years or older can misrepresent the true monetary value of our data given the current macro economic environment (inflation). 

 -In addition, relying soley on older data to influence current decisions is not taking into account the current environment and any possible new/emerging variables.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 -The months of May and June had the most successful outcomes out of any month of the year.

 -The months of November, December, and January had the lowest count of succesful outcomes thoughout the year.

 -Based on the data, launching a play in the months of May, June, and July give the campaign the most favorable chance of becoming successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 -Campaigns that had a funding goal greater than $45,000 and less than $49,999 had a 100% success rate.

 -Campaigns that had funding goals less than $5000 had a higher percentage of success (>50%). 

 -Campaigns that had funding goals greater than $5000 and less than $34999 had a success rate under 50%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 -I had difficulty formatting the graphs to an appropriate color scheme as well as finding the best way to label both X & Y axis.
## Results

1. What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   - We can conclude the following:
    1. The months of May and June had teh most successful outcomes out of any month of the year  
    2. The months of November, December, and January had the lowest count of succesful outcomes thoughout the year.
   - In summary, launching a play in the months of May, June, and July gives a Crowd Sourced theatre/play the most favorable chance of becoming successful.

2. What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
     - We can conclude that their is a greater percentage of success for Crowd Sourced theatre/plays if their funding goals are $10,000 or less.

3.  What are some limitations of this dataset?
     - The nature of the Crowd Sourced data gives us limitations. This data is likely collected form multiple surveys and people don't always provide accurate information.

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
     - Using a clustered column chart to show the outcomes of plays based on funding goals. In my opinion, this chart provides a much more clear visual representation of the data we are trying to convey.
